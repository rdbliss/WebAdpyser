# WebAdpyser

__WebAdvisor__, [according to Ellucian](http://www.ellucian.com/Software/Colleague-WebAdvisor/),

> [P]resents real-time information such as community news, services, e-commerce
> capabilities, and e-learning offeringsâ€”all from one central and secure
> location.

It is terrible. The less anyone has to interact with it, the better. To that
end, __WebAdpyser is a class/script that can currently scrape section
information from WebAdvisor__ instances, and has a __unix-like interface__.

By default, it uses [OASIS](https://oasis.oglethorpe.edu), but other sites that
work might be added via [wa.ini](./wa.ini).

A full listing of options can be found with the --help flag, but here are some
(trimmed) examples:

MAT-241-001 Proof and Logic P. Tiu 
This course serves as a general introduction to advanced mathematics.
As such, it will consider various methods of proof communicated
through good mathematical communication (both written and oral).
Topics are drawn from logic, set theory, functions, relations,
combinatorics, graph theory, and Boolean algebra. Offered every
fall semester.  Prerequisite: MAT 132 with a grade of "C-" or higher.
