# WebAdpyser

WebAdvisor (the actual web program) is terrible. The less anyone has to interact
with it, the better. To that end, __WebAdpyser__ is a class/script that can
currently scrape section information from WebAdvisor instances, and has a
unix-friendly interface.

By default, it uses [OASIS](oasis.oglethorpe.edu), but other sites that work can
be added via [wa.ini](./wa.ini).

A full listing of options can be found with the --help flag, but here are some
examples:

MAT-241-001 Proof and Logic P. Tiu 
This course serves as a general introduction to advanced mathematics.
As such, it will consider various methods of proof communicated
through good mathematical communication (both written and oral).
Topics are drawn from logic, set theory, functions, relations,
combinatorics, graph theory, and Boolean algebra. Offered every
fall semester.  Prerequisite: MAT 132 with a grade of "C-" or higher.
